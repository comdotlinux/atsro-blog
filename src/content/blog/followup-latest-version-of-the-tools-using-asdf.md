## Table of contents

Disclaimer!: This post only talks about `asdf` .  
afx is also quite new to me too and I don't have enough experience to help you out, maybe you can let me know or point
me in the correct direction if you find something and I will update it here.

We all make mistakes, mistakes are arguably what makes us humans, allow us to learn from them, and release a new (and
hopefully a better) version. However, Keeping up with this is a chore in a project at best and a security hole at the
worst, but syncing the versions is also an equally big concern from getting surprises within the team by subtle bugs
cause by such version mismatches.

All this to say is that the task of the tools we saw in the
earlier [post](https://blog.kulkarni.cloud/2022/10/08/on-the-topic-of-tools-their-versions-automated-installations/) is
not to always allow the use of the latest versions but to have some sanity in this increasingly chaotic (albeit
beautiful) and fast paced software development world. So there aren't any (direct / inbuilt) ways that I know of always
keeping you at the latest version. However, to sync the versions you use yourself and no one else on the team is a task
that almost guaranteed to be forgotten. That brings us to the question from the earlier post.

There is a way described
at `asdf` [documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/versions.html#install-latest-stable-version)

asdf install <name> latest

## Install latest stable version that begins with a given string.

asdf install <name> latest:<version>

However, I have not used it myself recently and earlier it did not work.

What do I use? a self developed shell script. (it probably does not work directly on
mac) : [update-asdf.sh](https://gist.github.com/comdotlinux/17cb87a055f0e2873448a04397416c30).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/comdotlinux/17cb87a055f0e2873448a04397416c30.js"></script>

Let's see it in action shall we?
https://youtu.be/BvPV7wIVcL8

This is what I use, and I know it's a little rough around the edges but get's the job done. What does it do?

1. Reads the `.tool-versions` and and adds all the plugins for each listed
   tool. [YMMV](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ymmv)
2. Updates all the Plugins (they are each their own git repo)
3. Runs `asdf install`
4. Asks if you want make all versions global. (just creates / appends / updates ${HOME}/.tool-versions)
5. Checks each plugin for a newer version and show top three versions.
   - Some personal optimizations are applied, like for java only use [temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/)
   - Ignore some alpha / beta / pre-dev / dev / some error versions seens
6. Then for each update show one line in place edit `sed` command to update individual tool
7. Also, a consolidated `sed` to update all tools at once
8. there is a `update-asdf.sh -n` flag that runs in non-interactively by saying yes but does not actually update any
   versions.

## alternative option

There's also an interesting use of
the [excellent `fzf` to update `asdf` tool versions](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/examples#asdf)

```bash
# Install one or more versions of specified language
# e.g. `vmi rust` # => fzf multimode, tab to mark, enter to install
# if no plugin is supplied (e.g. `vmi<CR>`), fzf will list them for you
# Mnemonic [V]ersion [M]anager [I]nstall
vmi() {
  local lang=${1}

  if [[ ! $lang ]]; then
    lang=$(asdf plugin-list | fzf)
  fi

  if [[ $lang ]]; then
    local versions=$(asdf list-all $lang | fzf --tac --no-sort --multi)
    if [[ $versions ]]; then
      for version in $(echo $versions);
      do; asdf install $lang $version; done;
    fi
  fi
}
```

In action

<div style="display: flex; align-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center">

   <iframe style="width: 80%; height: 35vh;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tFqGgLL6C4" title="Using fzf to install asdf tool versions" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

This too does not update the versions in the `.tool-versions` file, but probably is not too hard to add that in. This
exercise is left for the reader (I've always wanted to say that)

[![A monkeyuser comic on backlogs](../../assets/20221010/236-buglog.png)](https://www.monkeyuser.com/2022/buglog)

## Extro

Pick one from above, maybe modify it to update the tool to the latest and then run `asdf install` schedule the run of
the chosen method non-interactively and that should take you further until something breaks because of an update.

So that's it, hope this helps!
