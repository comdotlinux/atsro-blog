Impatient? then these are the tools we will discuss

- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) install it once and then after a few commands you have the tools installed.

- [afx](https://babarot.me/afx/) the command-line package manager

We developers love tools, we like to create them, use them and hope that they make our lives better as we are going about our day doing the things we do. You know don't you? "Working Hard or Hardly Working" -- I don't know who said that but I use it every chance I get.

Ever since the proliferation of GitHub and releases it has been quite easy to release a tool and post the binaries as release attachments. There was some work involved, you had to create a release (some GitHub additions to git tags), and then get the upload URL and upload the assets. But there were a host of tools to help with the process, and they helped but still some fiddling was required and not everyone who had the time to do so had the itch to not only scratch to tool, but also it's automation, or if they did they depended on tools that also were not updated if they had problems.

And then came GitHub actions, and they streamlined everything for nearly everyone to set it up once and the simply make changes, then release and the actions would take care of testing with different architectures, creating the final build, packaging and uploading the assets to the created release. Not to mention that they are now free for any public repository.

This is all great and are nice advancements to the high friction process of making software outside a large team, on your own, however what got lost in the process was the earlier ease of (sorry windows) installing nearly any required software by doing this

\# For Debian / Ubuntu and their derivatives
sudo apt install batcat

# For Fedora and other ditros using RPM packaging

sudo dnf install bat

# for mac (I think after installing homebrew once)

brew install bat

So what to do then? There's great software out there just waiting for us to use, but not as easy to use as above? Well 2 options really

- Install the tools Manually

  - Easy, just list the tools somewhere on a gist, manually install.

  - Not easy update though.

  - Cannot easily share with others and spread the joy.

- Use another tool to manage the tools
  - Setup Once and then every time it get's easier

  - Easy To Share

  - Commit to your (maybe private) repo and use it the next time you need a new setup; like me when distro hopping.

So, If you don't want to install manually then the following tools are for you!

---

## [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/)

#### "Manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool"

It's simple really, let's go though

- Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_1-install-dependencies) -- required only once :)

- get all available plugins and find the tool you are looking for

  - e.g. `asdf plugin list all | grep github-cli`

  - `asdf plugin add github-cli`

- create a file called `.tool-versions`

  - As the name indicates, this file contains the tools and their versions to install

  - e.g. `github-cli 2.16.1`

- then run `asdf install`

- (Optional) if you want the command to be available everywhere in your home directory
  - run `asdf global github-cli 2.16.1`

  - This simply creates / updates the `.tool-versions` in your home directory

  - just check by running `cat ~/.tool-versions`

That's it github cli should be available, try running `gh` to check

[Here](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-plugins#plugin-list) you can find all the plugins available, there are many and now available for you to use.

To create plugins is not that difficult either, see [here](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf/blob/master/docs/plugins/create.md), there are even some plugins that I've created just search for `comdotinux` there.

`asdf` allows to have different versions of tools in different directories and simply switching to them change to those versions.

## [AFX](https://github.com/b4b4r07/afx)

#### "AFX is a command-line package manager. afx can allow us to manage almost all things available on GitHub, Gist and so on."

So Let's Go

- Install [afx](https://babarot.me/afx/getting-started) - (Only Required Once)

- Create a file named `~/.config/afx/github.yaml`

- Fill In the following

github:

- name: stedolan/jq
  description: Command-line JSON processor
  owner: stedolan
  repo: jq
  release:
  name: jq
  tag: jq-1.6
  command:
  link:

  - from: '\*jq\*'
    to: jq

- Run `afx install`

That's it `jq` is installed, updating is also easy, update the version, run afx install.  
To uninstall, remove the section from yaml and run `afx uninstall`

Here's my current config yaml, as you can see it's much easier to install mostly anything with afx, like [prettyping](https://github.com/denilsonsa/prettyping) which does not have a release but is a shell script that you can install using `afx`

Here is my [**Gist**](https://gist.github.com/comdotlinux/bdd4a1a565280a87639dbf740b94f009) (Sometimes not shown properly when embedded)

Now you should have a nice control over your tools and moreover easy to spread the love <3  
So where did I get to know about these tools? A very good Question, most are from the excellent and relatively (to my knowledge) unknown blog post.  
[Command Line for the 21. Century: The Low HangingÂ Fruit](https://ileriseviye.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/command-line-for-the-21-century-the-low-hanging-fruit/)

Next Steps?

- Ability to install `afx` using `asdf` ;)

- Ability to install `asdf` using `afx` ;)

- Also remember to commit the `.tool-versions` and `github.yaml` to source control.
